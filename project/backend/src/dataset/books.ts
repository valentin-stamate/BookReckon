		"description": "Felix Sima, un tânăr de 18 ani, vine în București la unchiul său Costache Giurgiuveanu pentru a urma Facultatea de medicină. Ajuns la adresa indicată, Otilia, fata vitregă a bătrânului, îl invită în casă, unde îi cunoaște pe membrii familiei: mătușa Aglae, unchiul Simion și copiii acestora Titi, Aurica, Olimpia, ginerele Stănică Rațiu precum și prietenul de familie Leonida Pascalopol. A doua zi, Otilia îi arată locuința, el remarcă felul jucăuș al fetei și este surprins când găsește o scrisoare adresată acesteia, pe numele Otilia Mărculescu. Fata este râvnită de Leonida Pascalopol și invidiată de toți membrii familiei Tulea. Felix, curios de enigma numelui Mărculescu, descoperă soarta Otiliei care nu este cu mult diferită de a sa. Fata a rămas orfană de mică și este crescută de tatăl său vitreg, moș Costache. Pascalopol a cunoscut-o pe mama Otiliei și de atunci i-a ajutat foarte mult, Otilia purtându-i o stimă deosebită. Rugat de Aglae, Felix îl meditează pe Titi care a rămas corigent, și în aceste împrejurări sora sa Aurica se atașează de tânăr. El, însă, se simte tot mai atras de Otilia pe care o admiră și cu care petrece din ce în ce mai mult timp. Vede însă în Pascalopol un rival. La începutul lunii august, Olimpia, cel mai mare copil al Aglaei, își face apariția acasă împreună cu Stănică, concubinul ei, cu care are un copil. Simion nu-și recunoaște fiica și refuză să-i dea o casă de locuit și zestrea sa. Stănică, prin minciuni și scrisori adresate domnului Pascalopol cum că se împușcă, reușește să strângă ceva bani de la toți și să-l înduplece pe Simion cu motivarea că mai are câteva luni de trăit, să-i dea zestrea Olimpiei. La invitația lui Pascalopol, Felix și Otilia se duc la moșia acestuia, unde tinerii profită de timpul petrecut împreună, iar după două săptămâni revin acasă. Între timp, fiul Olimpiei și al lui Stănică, Aurel Rațiu, moare, iar tatăl, înduioșat, îi publică în ziar decesul, amintind toate rudele, în speranța de a obține cât mai mult sprijin financiar. Stănică este interesat de averea lui moș Costache și în acest scop îl aduce pe un oarecare doctor Vasiliade pentru a-i pune diagnosticul că este bolnav. Singurul care descoperă planul este Pascalopol, care îl avertizează pe bătrân. ",

Ce putea să însemne asta? Bălosu deveni chiar binevoitor faţă de vecinul său, iar Guica şi Parizianu le întrebau pe fete când le întâlneau pe drum dacă alde Paraschiv nu le - a mai scris.De Nilă şi Achim nu ziceau numic,     ca şi când din partea ăstora doi n - ar mai fi putut prididi să citească atâtea scrisori.Arăta tăcută Guica,     nu i se mai auzea deloc gura prin faţa casei,     pesemne că nepoţii aveau alte griji pe - acolo decât să - i trimită scrisori.în acei ani muri părăsită în bordeiul ei şi fu dusă la cimitir de Parizianu.Moromete,     cu toate că era vorba de sora lui mai mare,     nu veni nici măcar s - o vadă,     dar asta nu miră pe nimeni,     se cunoşteau în sat altele de acest fel mult mai rele.     Cu atât mai puţin băgă cineva de seamă că fi - său cel mic,     Niculae,     nu se mai ducea nici el la şcoală;deşi maică - sa vânduse.şi ea un pogon din pământul ei sa - l ţină mai departe,     totul se opri când trebuia să treacă pe al patrulea an: Moromete îi spuse,     fără multă vorbă,     că s - a terminat şi cu istoria lui cu studiile,     să stea acasă şi să pună mâna pe sapă.Băiatul nu se mai zbătu nici el ca la început,     nu se mai plânse nici pe lângă maică - sa,     şi nici pe lână preot sau fostul lui învăţător ca să - l ajute;cu tatăl său se întâmpla ceva.Nu se mai putea vorbi cu el,     spuneai una şi el asculta şi ai fi zis că înţelegea,     ca să te pomeneşti pe urmă că răspunsurile pe care ţi le dădea veneau din altă parte...Devenise în mod ciudat întreprinzător şi în anul când nu - i mai dădu voie lui Niculae să - şi urmeze şcoala(an în care începuse şi războiul) îi mergea destul de bine,     îşi făcuse un pridvor în faţa casei şi tot timpul umbla cu căruţa şi caii de la munte la baltă.Parcă chiar întinerise,     arăta zdravăn,     cu mustaţa mereu neagră şi când tot satul se pitea în casă şi coşurile fumegau sub gerurile năpraznice ale iernii,     era văzut cu alţii mai tineri,     cu săniile încărcate cu porumb,     gata ",

		"description": "Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo Baggins, his cousin[c] and heir. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's origin, but the wizard Gandalf suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, Gandalf tells Frodo that he has confirmed that the Ring is the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany him on his journey, but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot,     offering a cover story of moving to Crickhollow,     accompanied by his gardener Sam Gamgee and his cousin Pippin Took.They are pursued by mysterious Black Riders,     but meet a passing group of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion,     whose chants to Elbereth ward off the Riders.The hobbits spend the night with them,     then take an evasive short cut the next day,     and arrive at the farm of Farmer Maggot,     who takes them to Bucklebury Ferry,     where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck.When they reach the house at Crickhollow,     Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on travelling with Frodo and Sam.     They decide to try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest.Merry and Pippin are trapped by Old Man Willow,     an ancient tree who controls much of the forest,     but are rescued by Tom Bombadil.Leaving the refuge of Tom 's house, they get lost in a fog and are caught by a barrow-wight in a barrow on the downs, but Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight' s spell,     calls Tom Bombadil,     who frees them,     and equips them with ancient swords from the barrow - wight 's hoard. The hobbits reach the village of Bree,     where they encounter a Ranger named Strider.The innkeeper gives Frodo a letter from Gandalf written three months before which identifies Strider as a friend.Knowing the riders will attempt to seize the party,     Strider cunningly avoids their attack and leads the hobbits through the wilderness toward the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell.On the way to Rivendell,     the group stops at the hill Weathertop.Strider identifies the riders as the Nazgûl,     men from ancient times that were enslaved by lesser Rings of Power to serve Sauron.While at Weathertop,     they are again attacked by five of the nine Black Riders.During the struggle,     the Lord of the Nazgûl wounds Frodo with a cursed blade.After fighting off the Nazgûl,     Strider treats Frodo with the herb athelas,     and is joined by the elf Glorfindel who has been searching for the party.Glorfindel rides with Frodo,     now deathly ill,     toward Rivendell.The Nazgûl nearly capture Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen,     but upon attempting to cross the ford flood waters summoned by Elrond,     master of Rivendell,     and Gandalf rise up and overwhelm the Nazgûl.

He moves to a large house near the small town of Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their two young children, Ellie and Gage, and Ellie's cat, Winston Churchill (\" Church \"). From the moment they arrive, the family runs into trouble: Ellie hurts her knee, and Gage is stung by a bee. Their new neighbor, an elderly man named Jud Crandall, comes to help. He warns Louis and Rachel about the highway that runs past their house, which is frequented by speeding trucks. Jud and Louis quickly become close friends.Since Louis 's father died when he was three, he sees Jud as a surrogate father. A few weeks after the Creeds move in, Jud takes the family on a walk in the woods behind their home. A well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled \"sematary\" on the sign) where the children of the town bury their deceased animals. The outing provokes a heated argument between Louis and Rachel the next day. Rachel disapproves of discussing death, and she worries about how Ellie may be affected by what she saw at the \"sematary.\" It is explained later that Rachel was traumatized by the early death of her sister, Zelda, from spinal meningitis—an issue that is brought up several times in flashbacks. Louis empathizes with his wife and blames her parents for her trauma, who left Rachel at home alone with her sister when she died.",

		"cover": "WolfOfWallStreet.jpg",
		"description": 'Belfort begins his memoir with a brief story of how within six years, he rose from an entry level apprentice at a brokerage house to the founder of his own investment firm.  We do not read much about how his rapid ascent was accomplished, and that could have been quite interesting for ladder climbers. Though he started with less advantage than other Wall Street types, readers will not discover an American success story to be proud of. Belfort becomes the most narcissistic, immoral, crude, adulterous, drug induced, foul-mouthed, self-indulgent, and self-destructive ego-maniac that I have ever read about! Whatever the average person might consider morally or physically corrupt, you can be sure that Belfort was addicted to it.     This man’ s life was beyond dysfunctional.In many of his stories we learn of his wild promiscuity and his love of prostitutes(which he would charge to his corporate credit card).He even used a grading level for them and his favorites were the most expensive“ blue chips.”Perhaps he found prostitutes easier to deal with than his manipulative wife who used sexual favors in order to temporarily modify his behavior to her liking.Belfort spends much of his time high– in fact he risked countless lives by preferring to fly his helicopter while overloaded on a cocktail of drugs.The manner in which he writes about the different episodes of his life make it seem as if we as readers are supposed to cheer him on and root for him.
